# Introduction to Shiny

This repository contains the main tutorial files plus the exercises and examples for our introduction to Shiny apps in R.

- `Misk_shiny_intro`: The main tutorial site
- `Misk_shiny_examples`: Additional example useful for developing your own apps
- `Misk_shiny_exercises`: Exercises for our class

1. Install the `shiny`, `shinydashboard` and `shinythemes` pacakges in R.
1. Clone this repository
1. Open the `ui.R` file in the `Misk_shiny_intro` folder.
1. Execute the app by pressing the play button in RStudio.

When you attempt the exercises you will need to close the app, since you can only have one app running at a time. Thus, you may want to make a new project that contains only the exercises so that you can run them simultaneously.
